          Hello! My name is Doug Schallmoser and I am a software engineer living in Bellingham, WA. I love the challenge that coding brings and the subsequent potential it has to improve lives. On a more personal level, I love the outdoors and when I'm not programming I'm typically hiking somewhere in the mountains.

            CIVIL ENGINEER
            <p>
              I graduated from Florida Gulf Coast University in 2012 with BS degrees in Civil Engineering and Environmental Engineering. I went on to work for the Florida Department of Transportation as a civil engineer from late 2013 until early 2020. I learned many valuable things during this time, from technical engineering practices to project management skills. After obtaining my Professional Engineer (P.E) license, I made the decision to leave my job as I was overcome with a need to pursue a career more meaningful to me.

            SOFTWARE ENGINEER
            <p>
              My first experience with coding came in 2019 where I began watching lectures from Harvard's computer science course "CS50" in between studying for the exam. Before I knew it, I was hooked and wanted to pursue coding further. After relocating to Washington with my wife, I enrolled in Flatiron School's Software Engineering program and formally began over the summer. I graduated the program in November 2020 having spent 1200+ hours learning and coding during the five-month long program.

        I am continuing my personal education efforts by building new projects and adding to my software knowledge base. My passion for coding combined with my technical background in engineering provides me with a unique skillset and perspective on problem-solving in this vast world of technology and programming.
