            Hello! My name is Doug Schallmoser and I am a software engineer living in Bellingham, WA. I love the challenge that coding brings and the subsequent potential it has to improve lives. On a more personal level, I love the outdoors and when I'm not programming I'm typically hiking somewhere in the mountains.

                <p>
                  I graduated from Florida Gulf Coast University with B.S. degrees in Civil Engineering and Environmental Engineering. I went on to work for the Florida Department of Transportation as a civil engineer focusing on bridge repair and traffic operations. After obtaining my Professional Engineer (P.E.) license, I made the decision to leave my job to pursue my passion of programming.

                <p>
                  My first experience with programming came in high school where I dabbled in web development. In 2019, I began learning how to code online through Harvard's computer science course "CS50". Before I knew it, I was hooked and wanted to pursue coding further. I completed Flatiron School's Software Engineering program in 2020 and developed a real love for all things related to JavaScript.

            I am currently a Front End Engineer at CUNA Mutual Group helping build mortgage loan software for credit unions. My passion for coding, combined with my technical background in engineering, provides me with a unique skillset for approaching complex topics and tackling real-world problems.
